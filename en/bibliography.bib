	abstract = {In this paper, we present a user-centered design study on poetry visualization.
	We develop a rule-based solution to address the conflicting needs
	for maintaining the flexibility of visualizing a large set of poetic
	variables and for reducing the tedium and cognitive load in interacting
	with the visual mapping control panel. We adopt Munzner's nested
	design model to maintain high-level interactions with the end users
	in a closed loop. In addition, we examine three design options for
	alleviating the difficulty in visualizing poems latitudinally. We
	present several example uses of poetry visualization in scholarly
	research on poetry.},
