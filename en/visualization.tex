\chapter{Visualization}
To make the results more approachable for a common user, it is always better to visualize them in some way. Therefore, to demonstrate our detector's capabilities, we created a website that visualizes rhymes and their quality, shows statistics, and allows user to experiment with the parameters. This way, it can be used by anyone without any programming background.

\section{Input}
The input page consists of a text-box for song lyrics, a card with parameters, and an \textit{Analyze} button, as seen in Figure \ref{web-form}.

The text-box expects text input of song lyrics, separated into verses with newlines such that rhymes are at the end of the line. Once text is entered, \textit{Analyze} button will be enabled.

For analysis, the default parameters are pre-filled, but user can choose to change them. Selecting the checkbox \textit{Perfect rhymes only} will trigger the detector to only detect perfect rhymes. Changing the size of the window will affect how many lines apart can rhyme be. Smaller window is better for creating rhyme schemes, while longer window (e.g. equal to song length) will give better overview of rhyme repetition throughout the entire song and give a more interesting matrix visualization. \textit{Rhyme threshold} parameter sets the minimal rhyme rating -- rhymes with lower rating will be discarded.

Pressing the \textit{Analyze} button will start the analysis and minimize the input page. For the duration of rhyme detection, loader is shown to inform the user their request is being processed. When the back-end returns the results, analyze page is expanded to show the visualizations. If desired, user can expand input page, edit the input, and re-submit for analysis.

\section{Visualization of the results}
Visualization page contains lyrics with scheme, matrix visualization of rhymes, and short statistics. It is primarily designed for songs of short or moderate length, longer lyrics may not fit on the screen with the analysis side-by-side, and will have to be rearranged in a column, which makes the results less comfortable to read.

\subsection{Lyrics and statistics}
Lyrics with their assigned scheme letters and line number are shown on the left, as we can see in Figure \ref{web-analysis_window5}. Rhyming lines are highlighted, each with a color corresponding to its rhyme type. For the sub-types of perfect rhyme, we selected similar colors to indicate that they are more closely related -- namely red for \textit{masculine}, orange for \textit{feminine}, and yellow for \textit{dactylic} rhymes. \textit{Imperfect} rhymes are highlighted in blue and \textit{forced} in green color. When user hovers over a rhyming line, this line and all lines rhyming with it are highlighted.

Statistics is shown on the right under the matrix. It contains song rating and percentages of different rhyme types in the song.

\subsection{Matrix}
To make a creative visualization, we took inspiration from Colin Morris\footnote{\url{https://github.com/colinmorris}}. He came up with an idea to represent the repetitiveness of lyrics by self-similarity matrix and he demonstrated it in his project SongSim\footnote{\url{https://colinmorris.github.io/SongSim/\#/}}. In his matrix, there is one row and one column for each word of the song. For each cell, if the word in given row and column are identical, the cell is colored, otherwise it stays white (Figure \ref{songsim}).

\end{figure}

Instead of words, in our matrix we compare rhymes.

\section{Technologies}
For the front-end of web page we used a TypeScript-based open-source web application framework --  Angular (\cite{jain2014angularjs}). For some of the features, we used \textit{ngx-bootstrap},\footnote{\url{https://getbootstrap.com/}} which the Angular powered version of standard Bootstrap's components. Back-end is written in Python (\cite{van1995python}) and uses our detector, in a classic variant without any modifications, as it was used for the evaluation in Chapter \ref{evaluation}.

We host it at a public url \url{https://rhyme-detector.brezinovi.sk/} from our personal computer, so some short-term unavailability is possible. In case of any difficulties, please do not hesitate to contact us at \textit{patricia@brezinovi.sk}.
